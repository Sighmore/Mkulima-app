## Overview

In traditional farm settings, managing workers' payments based on the amount picked can be cumbersome, often relying on manual records and calculations. Mkulima addresses this by allowing farmers to input daily work details, such as worker names and kilos picked, and automatically calculates payments based on standardized rates. 

With this app, weâ€™re targeting a common challenge farmers face: streamlining payment management to improve accuracy and reduce the administrative burden of handling payroll for large numbers of farm workers.

## Technologies Used

The Mkulima app leverages the following Android development concepts:

1. **Kotlin**: Main language used for application logic.
2. **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI toolkit for building modern Android UI.
3. **Navigation Component**: Manages seamless transitions between screens.
4. **MVVM Architecture**: Separates UI and business logic.
5. **Room Database**: Provides local data persistence.
6. **LiveData and State Management**: Ensures UI updates in response to data changes.
7. **Coroutines**: Handles background tasks for a responsive UI.

## Architecture

This application follows the **MVVM architecture**:

- **Model**: The `TeaRecord` class holds data about the workerâ€™s name, total kilos, date, and payment amount.
- **View**: Composables like `PluckerScreen`, `WelcomeScreen`, and `TeaRecordList` manage the UI.
- **ViewModel**: `MkulimaViewModel` handles data flow and executes business logic.

Using **Coroutines** and **LiveData** provides non-blocking data handling and auto-updates UI with new information.
